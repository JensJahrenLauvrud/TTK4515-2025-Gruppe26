The project is easy to navigate in, a readme file or diagrams explaining the modules and their interaction would improve the initial understanding of the system architecture.
The modules are well-defined with descriptive names, but their interactions and data flow are not immediately clear. More documentation on what’s being sent between the modules  would be helpful.
main.go is doing too much, including sensor polling and direct state updates, which should be delegated to specialized modules.
By reading the files the function of the system is understandable, it is not immediately clear that the system follows a  master slave architecture without inspecting multiple files.
Function and variable names are well chosen, providing clear indications of their roles. The comments are helpful for understanding the code, and it’s good to see that there are already comments suggesting potential improvements and uncertainties. 
There is some error handling, such as detecting when an elevator becomes unresponsive. However, there is no clear strategy for reallocating tasks or reestablishing lost connections. A more structured failure recovery mechanism should be considered.  
Logging is minimal, making debugging difficult. There is no clear logging for network communication or FSM state transitions, making it harder to trace errors. Adding structured logs for message transmission, elevator state changes, and fault handling would improve observability.

- The code follows a modular approach with separate files for specific functionality, but lacks directory structure
- Good hardware abstraction with input/output device interfaces, making testing easier
- Extensive use of global variables makes dependencies between modules less explicit and harder to test
- State changes are often managed through side effects rather than returning new states
- Many functions don't handle errors robustly - some ignore return errors completely (especially in network code)
- The elevator_manager.go file combines too many unrelated responsibilities (master election, failure detection, request assignment)
- Some complex data structures and algorithms lack comprehensive documentation (particularly request handling logic)
