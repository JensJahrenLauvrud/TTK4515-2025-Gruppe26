Bonus points for using command line arguments to define a set for parameters and how to use them. Could have included more information about what kind of system this was. A single network unit is run, suggesting something like a master/slave -> primary/backup?
Main sets up some "elevator udp" and sets up a series of channels and threads. UDP modules seems to be a central piece, some commentary would be great in order to quickly clearify the function of the module. Commentary is supplied in most other files, which some room for interpretation, this is nice. Some comments are however nearly the same as function names etc and doesnt provide additional information. 
The statement: "Note also that this method will fail if the same datatype are included twice //in a category. It is solvable, but one have to be cautious about it." gives rust-unidiomatic vibes (unsafe behavior and could be prone to faults). Better options may exist? 
Code is consistently well formatted. No global variables. Naming makes sense. 
Little to no shared states. Instead channels are used which is good. 	 
Looking into Logic and Controller the feeling for primary/backup is reinforced, but we are still unsure. Unsure about what the controller actually does? The confusion could be due to the naming of the project as "single elevator" when it fact this is not for a single elevator. 	
Little to no error handling. except-statements give a decent print on where an error resides, but makes no effort to correct it in cases where this might be necessary. 
Gut feeling: 8. Code is well formatted and easy to read. Some more commentary initially would clearify what is aims to do. Smaller things are mentioned, but is easily corrected. Good start, while a good portion of work still remains.
