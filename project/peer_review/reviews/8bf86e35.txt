- Clear description of project in README.md, gives a clear sense of current state and future goals of the group.
- Intuitive function and variable names.
- Good modularization, easy to follow chain of events in different .go files.
- When going through the different libraries there was nothing in particular that seemed strange or missing to me.
- Good use of comments, not overly commented, but short and direct where clarification is needed.
- The project is not finished, but it seems like there is only fune-tuning left, I think this group will do great.
