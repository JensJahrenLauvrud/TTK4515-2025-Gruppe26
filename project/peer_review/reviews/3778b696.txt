The code containts useful comments, but they should be consistent and in the same language.
In fsm.rs, the "unsafe" keyword is used multiple times. By using "unsafe", you lose the benefits of rust's memory safety.  
The code is mostly consistent when it comes to using PascalCase for enums and structs (except for the enum tcp_message), and the rest of the code is consistent in using snake_case.
Prefixing the function names according to the module is unnecessary, because namespaces are used (for fsm).
No global variables are used, which makes it easy to track states.
The project seems to have a solid foundation with somewhat good structure, where features can be added.
The code is difficult to read at times, because of many commented lines as well as some files that are not included (tcp_elevator).
