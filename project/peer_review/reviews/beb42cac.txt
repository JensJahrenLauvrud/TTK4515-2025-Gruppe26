The class-based protocol is easy to follow and understand. The file system is well organized and not excessive in its quantity.
Blatant lack of documentation beyond comments made in code. However, the comments are descriptive and not overused in "obvious" areas. 
Code is generally well organized, but there are areas (such as network.py) in which some functions could be narrowed down into multiple, more specific ones.
Seems like the asyncio library is what is being used to handle threads and communications in all but the elevator_driver.py file where "threading" is used. Don't know how much it matters, but making asyncio the default across all files seems prudent for ensuring concurrency across every domain.
The reassigning of hall calls when a peer goes offline is well implemented.
The cost function is based on absolute distance, which is good, but it's conceivable that elevator direction could perhaps also be taken into consideration?
