driver-go has lots of different logic, not only the driver.
Functions do mostly one thing, and not too much, very readable.
Very maintainable networking.
Mostly good, but 200 char functions definitions is long. (Nitpick)
Some inconsistent variable naming. (Nitpick)
Mostly self documenting code, sparing use of comments.
Overall very approachable.
