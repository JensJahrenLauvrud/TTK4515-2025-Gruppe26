Reviewer 1:
8
Unnecessary libraries and files are included (Project-Resources, go.mod, Makefile, etc.).
There is no clear overview of the code, and package descriptions are inconsistent.
Some comments are redundant, while others are useful. Avoid comments where the code is self-explanatory.
The project structure is good, with clear naming conventions.
Nesting is kept at a reasonable level, making functions easy to follow.
Some Norwegian text is buried in the code/comments.
Function names are generally good, making it clear what the functions do in most cases.
